# EnterKeyRemap

## Problem 
Work specific excel like software always moves to the right instead of the down to the next cell when automatically importing checks through scales and measuring devices. 

## Solution 
After exploring the possibility and learning some Python i decided that AutoHotkey would be a better solution. It allowed me to use minimal code to remap the enter key to the down arrow key. Also allowed for me to be able to set toggle the remap with the F1 key to turn the remapping off. AHK also runs natively off of a flash drive with just the .exe file so nothing needed to be installed onto the work computer. It fit all my criteria
